# Houston Data Test – Project Scaffold

This repository is a ready-to-use scaffold for the 3-hour newsroom data test (Python + VS Code).

- Start in `docs/README.md` for the overview, methods, sources, and how to reproduce.
- Work in `notebooks/` or `scripts/` and write outputs to `output/`.
- Keep original data in `data/raw/` and derived files in `data/processed/`.

Quick map

- data/raw – original downloads (unchanged)
- data/processed – cleaned/derived CSVs/Parquet
- notebooks – exploratory/analysis notebooks
- scripts – helper scripts (optional)
- output/charts – exported PNG/SVG
- output/tables – exported CSVs
- docs – notes, methods, sources, AI usage, story outline
