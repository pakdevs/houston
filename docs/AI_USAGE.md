- Why accepted: [matches spec, small change, validated vs. manual expectations]
- Validation: [compared numbers to source; visual sanity check]

## Prompts rejected

- Task: [e.g., attempted over-complicated pipeline]
- Why rejected: [time-boxed; lacked source citations]

## Principle

AI assisted with boilerplate and options; all analysis logic and editorial judgments are mine. Figures were validated against source totals/spot-checks.
